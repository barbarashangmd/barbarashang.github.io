## What is Ophthalmology? 

Ophthalmology is the branch of medicine that deals with diseases of the eye. Ophthalmologists are trained to diagnose and treat eye problems, both common and rare, of all types. These include:  Diagnosis - The process of identifying disease or disorders by physical examination and testing. Treatment - The process of eliminating or reducing a patient's symptoms with or without surgery. Prevention - The prevention of ocular diseases before they occur with the aim of diminishing or eliminating the need for therapeutic intervention.  Ophthalmologists perform an enormous amount of vision-related tests. They may examine your eyes with a light or an instrument called a "fundoscope". They will look at images on a screen called "slit lamps" and take photographs of your eyes. They may order an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT (Computerized Tomography) scan of your brain and orbit to rule out or detect tumors or other abnormalities. 

## How To Become A Ophthalmologist? 

Most states have a residency program that lasts 3 to 4 years after which the candidate must pass a specialty board exam. In California, it takes about 6 years to train as an ophthalmologist. After graduation, ophthalmologists must complete three to six years of additional post-graduate training.  Some opt to go to another country to further their training. For example, there are numerous eye doctors from India, Pakistan, and the Philippines who have trained in India and are now practicing in the United States. These doctors have two to four years of training in an Indian medical school plus four to six years of additional post-graduate training in the U.S.  What this means for you is that most likely, you will be working with a doctor who has several years of additional experience compared to your own. This will give you a significant advantage when you are diagnosing and treating patients.  

## Why Visit A Ophthalmologist? 

Your eyes are important and your ophthalmologist is the expert you should turn to when you need treatment. When you go to a good ophthalmologist, he or she will not only examine your eyes but also take care to educate you about any condition they find. They will discuss treatment options with you and make recommendations based on their findings. Many times, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist can detect a condition before you even know you have it. That's because your eye doctor will be looking for certain signs and symptoms of disease in addition to performing a physical exam of your eyes. When you have a problem with your vision, it is important to remember that your eye doctor knows your vision well so they can detect conditions that might otherwise go unnoticed by you or others.  Is There A Doctor You Can Trust?  Yes, there is a doctor you can trust. Believe it or not, this has been true for thousands of years. After all, back then people trusted their doctors with their lives. Today, we still choose our doctors with this same level of trust but now we have the additional option of choosing between alternative medical specialists. When you are choosing a doctor, look for someone who:

## What Is University of California Los, Angeles? 

The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) is one of the best medical schools in the world. They have a 4-year graduate program in basic science (M.D.) and a 3-year program in clinical science (O.D.). Both programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 

## What Is University of California Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine? 

The UCLA medical school was established in 1960 and is part of the University of California system. It has an integrated curriculum with classes held on both the east and west coasts of California. There are about 1,800 students enrolled in the medical school at any given time. The school is divided into 10 academic departments: Anatomy, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell and Developmental Biology, Community Health, Economics, Epidemiology, Family Medicine, Medical Genetics, Neurobiology and Psychiatry, and Pathology.  The school offers both traditional and problem-based learning formats. Traditional means you take a test at the end of four years and if you score above a certain threshold you are awarded a medical degree. Problem-based learning means you are required to complete all of your requirements (such as taking multiple-choice exams) but you are also given problems to work on that are based on real-world situations. This type of education helps you learn how to think critically and solve problems rather than simply memorize facts.   

## What Is Purpose of Microbiology? 

The purpose of microbiology is to identify and characterize microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.) and their associated diseases (both infectious and non-infectious). By learning about microbes, we can learn more about our own bodies and how to keep it healthy. By learning about diseases caused by microbes, we can learn more about how to treat people so they may live longer, happier lives. Microbiology is an important part of modern medicine. It is used in everything from diagnosing bacterial infections to identifying cancer cells. Microbiologists study a wide variety of organisms including those that cause tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, leprosy, malaria, AIDS, botulism, tetanus, anthrax, viral infections, and many, many others. They also look at non-pathogenic (harmless) microbes like the ones that live in our digestive tracts and those that live in and on us and our animals. Microbiologists learn how different types of microbes interact with each other and how this affects human health. They also study how microbes affect the environment by determining what effect various microbe populations have on their respective environments. Microbiologists use a wide variety of techniques to study microbes.
